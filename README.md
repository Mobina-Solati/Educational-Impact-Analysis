Data Mining Project: Educational Impact Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between educational attainment, working hours per week, and financial metrics such as capital loss and capital gain. The dataset includes various visualizations and statistical analyses to explore these relationships.

Dataset

Source: The dataset contains features like hours-per-week, education-num, capital-loss, and capital-gain.
Format: Includes raw data matrices and processed outputs (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, Kernel PCA).
Visualizations: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and 3D plots to represent data correlations and distributions.

Analysis Techniques

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Used to reduce dimensionality and identify key variance factors.
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Applied for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D/3D space.
Kernel PCA: Employed to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
Correlation Matrix: Generated to understand the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

Visualizations

Heatmaps: Display correlation matrices and variance explained ratios.
Scatter Plots: Illustrate data points post-dimensionality reduction.
3D Plots: Provide a deeper insight into data distribution across multiple dimensions.

Instructions

Review the raw data and processed outputs in the provided images.
Analyze the heatmaps to identify significant correlations.
Explore the scatter and 3D plots for insights into data clustering and distribution.

Conclusion
The project aims to uncover patterns and insights into how education and working hours impact financial outcomes. Further analysis can be conducted by extending the dataset or applying additional machine learning techniques.
